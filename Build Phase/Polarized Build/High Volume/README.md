Polarized training is a way of organizing a training plan in which the majority of your time is spent training at either low or high intensity, with little time spent in between. This emphasis on the polar ends of the training intensity spectrum means you'll complete some very challenging workouts to build fitness, interspersed with easy workouts that don't contribute much extra fatigue.

The Polarized Build blocks are designed to build upon your aerobic base fitness with a growing emphasis on longer sustained threshold efforts, and the introduction of VO2max efforts when compared to Polarized Base. Following the traditionally referenced three-zone model for Polarized Training, these plans reside close to a polarized training intensity distribution between 80/20 and 95/5. For this High Volume Plan, you have two days of intensity with four days of endurance work.
