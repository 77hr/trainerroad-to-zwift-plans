Sustained Power Build plans are designed to develop their namesake skill: sustained power. They achieve this through a focus on strength endurance, lactate tolerance, and aerobic conditioning, all designed to improve your ability to go faster for longer. Athletes who can benefit well from these 8-week blocks include time trialists, century riders, and even road racers whose events feature long climbs.
