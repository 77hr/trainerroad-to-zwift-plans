Sustained Power Build plans build on your base fitness to target greater sustained-power capabilities. Most of the planâ€™s key workouts are aimed to improve strength endurance, fatigue resistance, and the mental ability to withstand prolonged discomfort. The plan also includes some higher-intensity VO2 max work to further develop your aerobic capacity.

This 8-week plan includes 6 workouts each week, with a maximum weekly time commitment around 9.5 hours. Week 4 reduces the intensity to facilitate recovery before things ramp back up, culminating in a reduced training load and final recovery period during week 8.

This high-volume version is aimed at experienced cyclists with a proven ability to productively complete (and sustainably recover from) high-volume training.
