Sustained Power Build plans build on your base fitness to target greater sustained-power capabilities. Most of the plan’s key workouts are aimed to improve strength endurance, fatigue resistance, and the mental ability to withstand prolonged discomfort. The plan also includes some higher-intensity VO2 max work to further develop your aerobic capacity.

Over the course of this 8-week low-volume plan, you’ll complete 3 workouts each week with a maximum weekly time commitment of 4 hours. Week 4 reduces the intensity to facilitate recovery before things ramp back up, culminating in a reduced training load and final recovery period during week 8.
