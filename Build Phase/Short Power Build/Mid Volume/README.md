Short Power Build is the season’s second training phase for riders who need the ability to generate repeated bursts of high power. Emphasizing power at VO2 max and repeatability, it sustains the aerobic conditioning you developed during the base phase while increasing your top-end fitness to make you faster.

Each of the mid-volume version’s 8 weeks includes 5 workouts, for a maximum weekly training volume of around 7 hours. Week 4 is designed to allow for recovery, as is the final week—so you’ll leave the plan well-rested and ready to begin the next phase of your training.
