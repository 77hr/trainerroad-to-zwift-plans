Short Power Build plans are perfect if your goals demand repeated bursts of aerobic power: criterium races, cyclocross events, and almost all forms of mountain biking and track cycling, for instance. These plans use VO2 max and other above-threshold intervals to develop powerful and repeatable top-end fitness, so by the end of an 8-week block youâ€™ll be ready to go deep when things get tough.
