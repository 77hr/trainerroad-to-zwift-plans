	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can’t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you’re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it’s important to give it everything you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there’s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you’re finished; click “End Test” and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tips and Hints:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you’re fueled, motivated, and well rested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there’s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-If you’re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
