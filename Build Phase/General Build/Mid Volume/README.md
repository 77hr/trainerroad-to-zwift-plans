General Build plans are designed to increase your fitness across the board, with an equal emphasis on raising your sustainable power, growing your aerobic capacity, and improving your ability to repeat all-out efforts. This diverse mix of skills can make you faster for almost any type of riding.

The mid-volume version of General Build does this in 8 weeks, each containing 5 workouts with a maximum weekly time commitment just under 7 hours. Week 4 is a bit easier to allow for recovery, as is the plan’s final week—so you can productively recover before moving on to the next phase of your training.
