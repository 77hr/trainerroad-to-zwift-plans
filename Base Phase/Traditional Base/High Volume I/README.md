The first 4 weeks of Traditional Base focus entirely on building aerobic endurance with low-intensity rides. With this high-volume version of the plan, riders will complete 4 relatively long workouts each week, with a maximum weekly time investment of 10 hours.

This plan is designed to be followed up with Traditional Base II.
