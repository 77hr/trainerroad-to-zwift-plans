Traditional Base is a time-honored approach to base training, building resilient aerobic fitness with comparatively long and low-intensity workouts. Divided into three 4-week blocks meant to be completed in order, these plans gradually introduce intensity over time, slowly but steadily preparing athletes for a successful season. While this approach is usually associated with high training volumes, the low- and mid-volume versions have proven effective for time-crunched athletes.
