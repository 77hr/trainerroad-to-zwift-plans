The second part of Traditional Base maintains the previous 4 weeks’ focus on aerobic endurance, but adds some Sweet Spot and Tempo workouts to start developing sustained power and muscular endurance. The high-volume version of the plan includes 5 relatively long workouts each week, with a maximum weekly time investment of 12 hours. The plan’s final week is a little easier than the weeks that came before it to allow for recovery.

This plan is designed to be followed up with Traditional Base III.
