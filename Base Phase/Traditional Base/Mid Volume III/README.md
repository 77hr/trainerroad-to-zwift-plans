The final 4 weeks of Traditional Base continue the preceding weeks’ exclusive focus on aerobic fitness, with a particular emphasis on muscular endurance and sustained power. The mid-volume version of the plan includes 5 workouts each week (with a long ride each weekend) for a maximum weekly time investment of 9.5 hours. The plan’s final week maintains the same volume but is a bit easier than the weeks that came before it to allow for recovery.
