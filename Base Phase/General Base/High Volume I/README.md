General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans.  

The high-volume version of General Base I includes 3 Sweet Spot/ Threshold workouts and 3 Endurance spins during each of its first 3 weeks, and a final recovery week of Endurance training. With a weekly commitment of about 9.5 hours, you’ll establish a strong aerobic base on which you can build peak fitness later on. 

We recommend high volume only for athletes who are experienced with interval training and have plateaued with the mid-volume version of the plan. We don’t recommend high volume for cyclists who intend to add additional rides beyond their plan’s scheduled workouts; these athletes are better served by the low- or mid-volume version.

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with its successors, General Base II and III.
