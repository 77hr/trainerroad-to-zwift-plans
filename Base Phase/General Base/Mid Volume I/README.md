General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans.  

The mid-volume version of General Base I includes 3 key workouts and 2 easier Endurance spins during each of its first 3 weeks, and a final recovery week of Endurance training. With a weekly commitment of about 6.5 hours, you’ll establish a strong aerobic base on which to build peak fitness later. 

We recommend this volume for athletes who are experienced with interval training and have plateaued with the low-volume version of the plan. We don’t recommend mid volume for cyclists who intend to add a lot of additional riding outside of their plan’s scheduled workouts; these athletes are better served by the low-volume version.

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with its successors, General Base II and III.
