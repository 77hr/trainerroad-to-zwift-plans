General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans.  

General Base III builds on the preceding General Base II, with a VO2 Max workout every Tuesday to build your aerobic edge. Each week’s time commitment is about 3.5 hours.

We recommend this volume as a starting point for most athletes before training at mid- or high- volumes. We especially recommend it if you’re new to structured training, if you plan to add additional rides on top of your scheduled workouts, or if you’re short on time and want to make the most of every minute on the bike.  

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with its predecessors, General Base I and II.
