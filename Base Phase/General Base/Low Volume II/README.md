General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans.  

General Base II builds on the preceding General Base I plan, introducing some VO2 max in the third week to start sharpening your aerobic fitness. The overall level of weekly training stress remains relatively consistent, however, to gradually progress your fitness with a full season in mind. The first 3 weeks include 3 challenging workouts each, with a shift to easy endurance riding and recovery during week 4. Each week’s time commitment is about 3.5 hours.

We recommend this volume as a starting point for most athletes before training at mid- or high- volumes. We especially recommend it if you’re new to structured training, if you plan to add additional rides on top of your scheduled workouts, or if you’re short on time and want to make the most of every minute on the bike.  

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with General Base I and General Base III.
