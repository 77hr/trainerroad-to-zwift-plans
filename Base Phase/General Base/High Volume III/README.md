General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans.  

General Base III builds on the preceding General Base II, with a VO2 Max workout every Tuesday to build your aerobic edge. Each week’s time commitment is around 9.5 hours.

We recommend high volume only for athletes who are experienced with interval training and have plateaued with the mid-volume version of the plan. We don’t recommend high volume for cyclists who intend to add additional rides beyond their plan’s scheduled workouts; these athletes are better served by the low- or mid-volume version.

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with its predecessors, General Base I and II.
