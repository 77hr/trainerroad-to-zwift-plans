General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans. 

The low-volume version of General Base I makes optimal use of your training time, with 3 high-quality workouts during each of its first 3 weeks, and a final recovery week of easy Endurance training. With a weekly time commitment of under 4 hours, you’ll establish a strong aerobic base on which to build peak fitness later. 

We recommend this volume as a starting point for most athletes before training at mid- or high- volumes. We especially recommend it if you’re new to structured training, if you plan to add additional rides on top of your scheduled workouts, or if you’re short on time and want to make the most of every minute on the bike.  

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with its successors, General Base II and III.
