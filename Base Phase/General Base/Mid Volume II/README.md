General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans.  

The mid-volume version of General Base II builds on the preceding General Base I plan, introducing some VO2 max work in the third week to start sharpening your aerobic fitness. The first 3 weeks include 3 challenging workouts each, with a shift to all easy endurance riding and recovery during week 4. Each week’s time commitment is about 6.5 hours.

We recommend this volume for athletes who are experienced with interval training and have plateaued with the low-volume version of the plan. We don’t recommend mid volume for cyclists who intend to add a lot of additional riding outside of their plan’s scheduled workouts; these athletes are better served by the low-volume version.

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with General Base I and III.
