General Base is an efficient and athlete-proven foundation for your cycling season, and an excellent starting point for all Build Phase training plans.  

Like the preceding General Base I plan, the high-volume version of General Base II includes 3 challenging workouts and 3 Endurance rides each week, with a final recovery week of Endurance training. Week 3 introduces some VO2 max work to begin sharpening your aerobic fitness, a focus that continues into General Base III. Each week’s time commitment is around 9.5 hours.

We recommend high volume only for athletes who are experienced with interval training and have plateaued with the mid-volume version of the plan. We don’t recommend high volume for cyclists who intend to add additional rides beyond their plan’s scheduled workouts; these athletes are better served by the low- or mid-volume version.

Whenever possible, this plan is designed to be completed back-to-back with General Base I and II.
