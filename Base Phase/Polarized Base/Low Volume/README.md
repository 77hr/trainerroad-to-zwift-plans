Polarized training is a way of organizing a training plan in which the majority of your time is spent training at either low or high intensity, with little time spent in between. This emphasis on the polar ends of the training intensity spectrum means you'll complete some very challenging workouts to build fitness, interspersed with easy workouts that don't contribute much extra fatigue. For the Base Phase, ramp rates are conservative and the intensity work is limited to Threshold efforts.

The Polarized Base blocks are designed to establish your aerobic base fitness with an emphasis on shifting training intensity to the ends of the spectrum and feature simplified threshold workouts as the high-intensity portion of these plans. Following the traditionally referenced three-zone model for Polarized Training, these plans reside close to a polarized training intensity distribution between 80/20 and 95/5. For this Low Volume Plan, you have one day of intensity with two days of endurance work.
