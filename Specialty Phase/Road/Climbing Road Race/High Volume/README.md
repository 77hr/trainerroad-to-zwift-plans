For rides and races on roads with long climbs, the final phase of training is designed to equip athletes with a well-rounded but specialized skill set. This includes endurance to last through multi-hour events, the ability to explosively surge across gaps, and especially the strength to sustain multiple near-FTP efforts up long climbs.

The high-volume version of the 8-week Climbing Road Race specialty plan includes 6 workouts per week, each ranging from 60 to 150 minutes. The last 2 weeks of the plan serve as a taper, reducing volume but maintaining intensity in the final leadup to your goal event. 

To practice racecraft and pack handling skills, you can occasionally substitute practice races or tough group rides for scheduled interval workouts, but try to make sure these rides are similar in structure to (at least as challenging as) the workout youâ€™re replacing.

As with all our high-volume plans, this plan is intended for experienced athletes who have plateaued at lower volumes.
