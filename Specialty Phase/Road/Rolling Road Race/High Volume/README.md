For athletes targeting rides and races on rolling roads, the final phase of training is designed to form a well-rounded competitor—one with strong endurance and sustained power, as well as the ability to surge across gaps, up short climbs, and through the final sprint.

The high-volume version of the 8-week Rolling Road Race specialty plan is built around 6 rides per week, each ranging from 60 to 150 minutes in length. The last 2 weeks of the plan serve as a taper, reducing volume but maintaining intensity in the final leadup to your goal event. 

To practice racecraft and pack handling skills, you can occasionally substitute practice races or tough group rides for scheduled interval workouts, but try to make sure these rides are similar in structure to (at least as challenging as) the workout you’re replacing.

As with all our high-volume plans, this plan is intended for experienced athletes who have plateaued at lower volumes.
