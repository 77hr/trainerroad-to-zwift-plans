Rolling roads make for highly variable races and rides, with repeated all-out attacks testing your fitness over punchy climbs. Sustained power and endurance are serious assets on this terrain, but the ability to respond to frequent surges and changes in pace is equally important. And in the end, success on rolling parcours demands a strong sprint, too.

The Rolling Road Race specialty plans are designed to address this diverse skillset, fine-tuning your sprint and anaerobic power, improving power and time at VO2 max, and maintaining your aerobic endurance.
