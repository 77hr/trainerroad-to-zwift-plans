Unlike other disciplines where athletes can recover mid-pack between efforts, time trials are truly unrelenting. Time trialists need the ability to ride steady and ride hard—for extended periods—in an uncomfortable aerodynamic position. It’s a true test of fitness and willpower, and the 40k TT plans are designed to develop both aspects of time trial performance.

These plans target sustained power, as well as an ability to pace yourself and tolerate discomfort. You’ll spend lots of time near threshold in aero position, fine-tuning your fitness for the race against the clock.
