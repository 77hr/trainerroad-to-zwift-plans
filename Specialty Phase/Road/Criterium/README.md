Criteriums are notoriously challenging. These relatively short races favor riders who can surge above threshold dozens of times in a rowâ€”all before unleashing an all-out sprint for the finish line. This requires serious aerobic endurance, a high anaerobic capacity, an effective ability to recover, and the neuromuscular coordination to sprint powerfully when tired.

The Criterium Specialty Plans are designed for the needs of criterium racers, as well as any other cyclist whose rides incorporate lots of repeated all-out efforts. Ideally completed following a Short Power Build phase, this plan further sharpens your ability to attack and drop your competitors, over and over again.
