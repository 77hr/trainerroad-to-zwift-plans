The Criterium specialty plans are designed to complete your preparation for these dynamic events. Placing a heavy emphasis on repeatable high power, they also maintain your ability to sustain high power for the duration of a tough race. Whether your strategy is to repeatedly attack, get in the breakaway, or wait for the final sprint, these plans will leave you ready for criterium success.

The high-volume version of the 8-week Criterium specialty plan includes 6 workouts per week, each ranging from 60 to 150 minutes. The last 2 weeks of the plan serve as a taper, reducing volume but maintaining intensity in the final leadup to your goal event. 

To practice racecraft and pack handling skills, you can occasionally substitute practice races or tough group rides for scheduled interval workouts, but try to make sure these rides are similar in structure to (at least as challenging as) the workout youâ€™re replacing.

As with all our high-volume plans, this plan is intended for experienced athletes who have plateaued at lower volumes.
