For athletes who are targeting long gravel races, gran fondos, or spirited multi-hour group rides, the Gran Fondo plans are the ideal choice. These specialty blocks primarily focus on muscular endurance, equipping you to pedal powerfully for hours on end over widely-varied terrain. But they also include some higher-intensity VO2 max efforts, so youâ€™ll have the fitness you need to stay at the front when the pace rises.
