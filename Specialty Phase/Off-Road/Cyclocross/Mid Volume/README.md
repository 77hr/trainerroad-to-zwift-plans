Cyclocross is an especially challenging discipline, so the Cyclocross specialty plan is designed to optimize wide-ranging fitness for the unpredictable demands of race day. From high-end sustainable power, to repeated surges with little recovery, to everything in between, this plan is the key to elevating your cyclocross success.

The mid-volume version of this 8-week plan includes five 60- to 120-minute bike workouts per week, with running and skills work left up to you. An easier 4th week offers the chance for some mid-plan recovery, and the last 2 weeks of the plan serve as a taper, reducing volume but maintaining intensity in the final leadup to your goal event.
