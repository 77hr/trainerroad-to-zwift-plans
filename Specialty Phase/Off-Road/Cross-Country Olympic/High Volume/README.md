With a focus on repeatable bursts of power and sustained high-watt efforts, the Cross Country Olympic specialty plan prepares you for the varied, high-intensity nature of XC racing. Whether your goal event features wide open fire roads, rocky singletrack, or a mix of both and more, youâ€™ll develop wide-ranging fitness and arrive at race day in peak form.

The high-volume version of this 8-week plan includes 6 workouts per week, each ranging from 60 to 150 minutes in length. An easier 4th week offers the chance for some mid-plan recovery, and the last 2 weeks of the plan serve as a taper, reducing volume but maintaining intensity in the final leadup to your goal event. 

As with all our high-volume plans, this plan is intended for experienced athletes who have plateaued at lower volumes.
