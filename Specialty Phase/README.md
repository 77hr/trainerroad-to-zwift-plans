You laid the foundation in the Base phase, and you improved your fitness in the Build phase. Now itâ€™s time to shift focus and shape that fitness towards the specific demands of your goal events. These 8-week discipline-specific blocks are the final path to race day, preparing you for big success when it matters most.

Each Specialty block can be extended up to 5 weeks longer should your level of experience and conditioning allow it by repeating the plan's final week. In the event you have multiple peaks on your calendar, ones that allow sufficient recovery & rebuild durations, simply repeat your Specialty blocks starting at whichever week best aligns with your later event dates.
