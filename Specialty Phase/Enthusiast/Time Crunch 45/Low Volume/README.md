The Time Crunch 45 plan is designed for busy athletes with a little more time to spare than those choosing the Time Crunch 30 plan. It uses 8 weeks of high-intensity 45 minute workouts that make the most of your limited training time, maintaining or even building fitness with just a few short workouts per week.

The low-volume version of the plan includes 3 workouts per week for 8 weeks. Each of the short-but-challenging workouts in this plan includes a warmup, a main set, and a quick cooldown. If you find yourself with extra time, you can extend the workout’s warmup from within the TrainerRoad app, or use the Alternates function to choose a slightly longer version of your scheduled ride. But if all you have is 45 minutes to spare, you won’t find a more productive use of your time than these workouts.

This plan doesn’t include recovery weeks and isn’t progressive in design, which means it doesn’t build training stress week-over-week the way discipline-specific plans do. Instead, it offers an efficient and effective way to make the most of very limited time. It’s also highly flexible, so feel free to move workouts around, select easier/harder alternates, or substitute outside rides as time allows—so long as you allow yourself ample recovery.
