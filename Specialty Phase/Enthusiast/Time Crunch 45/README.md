The Time Crunch 45 specialty plans are for athletes who canâ€™t afford to devote long hours to training, but who have 15 more minutes available each day than athletes following the Time Crunch 30 plan. Those extra 15 minutes go a long way, and for many cyclists this minimal amount of high-intensity training can be enough to maintain or even improve fitness.
