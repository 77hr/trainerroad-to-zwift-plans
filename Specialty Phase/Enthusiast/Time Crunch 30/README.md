Time is a finite resource, and for busy athletes, other obligations need to come before spending hours on the bike. Sometimes this doesn’t even leave enough time for a standard low-volume plan, and that’s when the Time Crunch specialty phases shine. If you’re short on time and looking to maintain general fitness, look no further.

Each workout in the Time Crunch 30 plan is 30 minutes long, chosen to optimize the effect of short training sessions. The low-volume version of the plan is built around high-intensity intervals, and the mid-volume version adds easy endurance rides once a week.
