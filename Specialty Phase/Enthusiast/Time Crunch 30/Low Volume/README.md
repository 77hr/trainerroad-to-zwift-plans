The Time Crunch 30 plan is designed for very busy athletes, with a series of high-intensity half-hour workouts that make the absolute most of your limited training time. It’s amazing what just a little bit of hard work each week can do to maintain or even build fitness!

The mid-volume version of the plan includes five 30-minute workouts per week for 8 weeks. Most of the workouts are short but quite challenging, each including a warmup, a main set, and a quick cooldown; 1 easier endurance spin each week aids recovery. If you happen to find yourself with a little extra time, you can extend any workout’s warmup from within the TrainerRoad app, or use the Alternates function to choose a slightly longer version of your scheduled ride. But if all you have is 30 minutes to spare, you won’t find a more productive use of your time than these workouts.

This plan doesn’t include recovery weeks and isn’t progressive in design, which means it doesn’t build training stress week-over-week the way discipline-specific plans do. Instead, it offers an efficient and effective way to make the most of very limited time. It’s also highly flexible, so feel free to move workouts around, select easier/harder alternates, or add additional rides as time allows—so long as you allow yourself ample recovery.
