Not every cyclist is targeting specific events, and sometimes your goal isn’t so much to build fitness as it is to maintain what you already have. If this describes you, consider the Maintenance specialty plans. These interchangeable 2-part blocks incorporate a mix of high-intensity workouts to keep you sharp, with added endurance workouts in the mid and high-volume versions to maintain base fitness. These plans are challenging by design, but they’re a truly effective and rewarding way to stay fit and fast.
